🏛️ Justice Client Portal

Project Overview

This is a full-stack client portal application designed for a law firm, built using a modern containerized architecture. It features a secure login/signup system that connects a static frontend to a dedicated authentication API and a NoSQL database.

The entire application is deployed using Docker Compose with three interconnected services.

Architecture

The application runs as a three-tier system managed by Docker Compose:

Service	Role	Technology	                                                            Port
Frontend	   Client Interface, Static Assets	Nginx, HTML, CSS, JavaScript	        Host 8080
API/Backend	   Authentication, Business Logic	Node.js (Express), bcryptjs, Mongoose	Host 3000
Database	   Persistent User Data Storage	MongoDB	                                    Host 27017

That's a fantastic idea! A README.md file is the essential documentation for any project, especially one that uses Docker and a multi-container architecture. It tells others (and your future self) what the project is, how it works, and how to run it.

Here is a complete README.md file for your Justice Client Portal project.

Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you must have the following installed:

    Git

    Docker (includes Docker Engine)

    Docker Compose

Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository, build the containers, and run the application.

1. Clone the Repository

   git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
cd justice-client-portal

2. Project Structure

Ensure your file structure matches the one expected by the docker-compose.yml file:

justice-client-portal/
├── docker-compose.yml          # Defines the 3 services (frontend, api, mongodb)
├── Dockerfile                  # Builds the Nginx Frontend image
├── html/                       # Static files
│   ├── front.html              # Main dashboard page
│   └── signup7in.html          # Login/Signup form with API calls
└── backend/                    # Node.js API files
    ├── Dockerfile              # Builds the Node.js API image
    ├── package.json
    └── server.js               # Express server with /login and /signup routes

3. Build and Run the Containers

Use Docker Compose to build the custom images and start all three services simultaneously.
Bash

docker compose up --build -d

    --build: Forces a fresh build of the frontend and api images.

    -d: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).
    
4. Access the Application

Once the containers are running (this may take a minute for the first build), open your web browser:

Login/Signup Page:

      http://localhost:8080/signup7in.html            


Usage Instructions

    Signup: Go to the "Create Account" tab and register a new user with an email and password. This will save the credentials (with a hashed password) to the MongoDB database.

    Sign In: Switch to the "Sign In" tab and use the registered credentials.

    Redirection: Upon successful authentication via the Node.js API and MongoDB, the frontend will automatically redirect you to front.html.

http://localhost:8080/signup7in.html
